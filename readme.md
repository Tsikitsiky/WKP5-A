## What I succeded to do in this project

In this project,

- I succeded to display the object by creating the html on javascript and add some style.

- I also succeded to show the modal after clicking the more info buttton and closing it by a click outside or escape.

- and finally I could show the modal to display a form after clicking the add recipe button and close it.

## About the project

In general, my poject didn't meet the requirements as I couldn't achieve it untill the end.

If had more time, I would have focused more on the form. Making it scrolling so that I can submit and storing the input into the object. Beside from that, I would have searched for a way to display the ingredients and steps as a list.
